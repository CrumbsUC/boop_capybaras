## What is Capybara Catch?

How many capybaras can you collect in your picture? This game tests your reaction time and skill on taking a picture with the most capybaras. Then choose from the three pictures and mint a personal NFT. Move the frame with W-A-S-D until you find the perfect shot. Press space as fast as you can with as many Cabybaras. The picture is then minted into a NFT on Polkadot.



# Features - 
***Unique network*** powered by Polkadot for minting NFTS.

***Imgur API*** for immediate uploads of pictures taken.

# Demo -
