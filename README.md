## What is Capybara Catch?

Capybara Catch brings a fresh take to the picture game genre, allowing gamers to capture and store their favorite in-game moments as NFTS.


## Instructions 
How many capybaras can you collect in your picture? This game tests your reaction time and skill on taking a picture with the most capybaras. Then choose from the three pictures and mint a personal NFT.
Move the frame with W-A-S-D until you find the perfect shot. Press space as fast as you can with as many Cabybaras. The picture is then minted into a NFT on UniqueScan.

## Full Description

NFTs are widely viewed as a monetary investment. We want to shift the focus of NFTs to use them to capture your favorite moments in gaming. Our goal was to use the Polkadot blockchain as a secure photo gallery for storing NFT. We leveraged the Unique Network, powered by Polkadot, to upload the pictures quickly and safely. 

# Features - 
***Unique network*** powered by Polkadot for minting NFTS.

***Imgur API*** for immediate uploads of in-game mouments.

# Demo -
